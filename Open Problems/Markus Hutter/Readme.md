Problems as listed on his [personal page](http://www.hutter1.net/)

### Problem 2.3 (Martin-Löf random sequences and convergence):
100 Euro are offered for the construction of a universal semimeasure with posterior convergence individually for all Martin-Löf random sequences. Universal may be defined in either of the following ways:
(a) dominating all enumerable semimeasures Eq.(2.27),
(b) being Solomonoff's M for some universal Turing machine U Eq.(2.21),
(c) being Levin's mixture ξU for some U with general weights Eq.(2.26).

### Problem 2.7 (Lower convergence bounds and defect of M)
100 Euro are offered for showing a lower bound for Mnorm similar to the one given for M, or for showing an upper bound better than O(2-K(t)).

### Problem 3.3 (Comparing two mixtures)
50 Euro

### Problem 3.10 (Individual ξ to μ convergence) See Problem 2.3.

### Problem 6.2 (Prediction loss bounds for AIXI)
100-500 Euro. This is one of the core open questions regarding AIXI. Proving non-asymptotic value bounds or related optimality properties. Prize depends on achieved progress in this question.

### Problem 6.3 (Posterization of prediction errors)
100 Euro

#### The Meanings of AIXI

> * AIXI stands for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on Solomonoff's distribution ξ (Greek letter Xi)
> * AIXI stands for Artificial Intelligence (AI) crossed (X) with Induction (I)
> * AIXI is a Catalan word (així) meaning 'in this way' or 'like that' (and with some liberties 'this is it!')
> * AIXI stands for action ai and perception xi≡oiri in cycle i (see above)
